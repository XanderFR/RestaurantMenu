# RestaurantMenu
A Django-based web application that simulates a restaurant menu. The front-end of the app presents different courses: starter foods, salads, main dishes, and desserts.
It also presents the foods' ingredients, price, and if it is available (unavailable foods are crossed out). All of this information is fed into the app and its associated SQLite database through its back-end admin interface (courtesy of Django).
The app also has a Bootstrap-based navigation bar with links to a home page menu and an about page with some basic info about the app. The app can also produce a QR code meant to take users to it via a smartphone app.
